## About raw php integration
Here I simply integrates a raw PHP script with a Laravel Blade view to create a word count feature. The process involves a button triggering a JavaScript function that sends a POST request with note content to a PHP script located in the "public/" directory. The PHP script validates and processes the input by stripping HTML and counting words, then returns the count as JSON. The Laravel frontend then displays this result dynamically. Key file locations are "resources/views/notes/show.blade.php" for the view of word count and "public/raw_wordcount.php" for the PHP script. This setup shows Laravel's ability to work with raw PHP without needing Laravel's routes or controllers.
